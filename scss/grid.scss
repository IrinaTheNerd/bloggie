//Grid mixin, done with responsivegrid.com and
//http://thesassway.com/intermediate/simple-grid-mixins

/*
noow, there are two ways of creating the grid for my blog system:
1st generate the grid with a mixin and write new grid classes that could be called in the html
2nd generate mixin and write includes into already created html elements

I'm using 2nd version after consulting with Joanne, to me it's easier to manipulate and maintain.
For a bigger project a full grid system would be applied.

the grid is also inspired by the previously used grid responsivegridsystem.com

@mixin row() {
  float:left;
  display:block;
  overflow: hidden;
  clear:both;

@mixin col($col, $sum, $gap:0.6%, $align:top, $first:false) {
  width:100%;
  font-size: inherit;
  float:left;
  display: inline-block;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  padding: 1% 0 1% 0;
  @media screen and (min-width: 35.5em) {
      width:percentage($col/$sum);
      vertical-align: $align;
      padding:1% 0;

  }
